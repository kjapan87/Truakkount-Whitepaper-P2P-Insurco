# Case for Zero Premium Insurance Policy
* Why pay a hefty premium to an Insurance company that neither you nor your associates or employees gets to reap the benefits of?
* Premium paid goes towards policy administration and management of the fund and from the same fund you get your claim amount, so why do you need to pay to a 3rd party for something that you can do yourself?
* Through this whitepaper our purpose is to introduce a Full Stack DeFi Solution aimed towards Affinity Groups (employees, associations, unions etc.), so that these groups can create self managed, self-financed, multi-currency pooled fund for group insurance or fund management. 
* The usage of group is free for these affinity group members with a unique freemium subscription model for both end users and a key partners. 
* We will explain the business model and underlying magic as to why adapting this solution might be the right fit for your needs.
* The Timing is perfect for this platform because of large market demand and lack of competition for this customer segment. 

# Background of the Need for a DeFi P2P System
Insurance as a field has had an immense impact on human civilization. First introduced as a concept of state sponsored debt commutation by the Babylonians in the Hammurabi code to the 16th century concept of private companies’ accepting risk and insuring ships traveling to Americas, the concept of central authority granting a peace of mind to its subscriber i.e. citizens or policyholders has held its format even to the modern era of risk management. 

The modern concept of Insurance’s basic structure remains the same  with technological and statistical advances built on the original Llyod’s framework, one thing remains unchanged i.e. the central authority accepting the risk by charging a premium in return for keeping the promise of paying for the quantifiable loss.

The discontent about central authority acting as the sole arbitrator of loss-assessment and claims-management has what led to a spurt of Insurtech companies utilizing technologies such a Distributed Ledgers Technologies (DLTs), Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies and  trying to find a solutions for truly democratized Insurance structure thereby removing the conflict of interest wherein the arbitrator of loss assessment i.e. Insurcos is also the party solely affected by the severity of claims payout.   

There are many whitepapers and concepts related to Peer-to-Peer insurance (P2P) solutions as of 2022. One of such platforms is the concept floated by NexusMutual.io, through its whitepaper has acted as the base upon which Truakkount builds on and tries to find the solution not yet solved by NexusMutual and/or its competitors.

The concept paper written by the Founders of NexusMutual is the basis of P2P arguments as put in this whitepaper, but I have included many other features and solutions thereby trying to solve all major issues as faced by a general Finco/Insurco P2P platform. 

 

# Current P2P DeFi Problems and its Solution
Truakkount takes on the challenge of solving the 9 core issues faced by any P2P DeFi platform (both Finco/Insurco), some of which has already been solved in the Beta Version, while other although remains unsolved but has been taken in consideration while drawing the system architecture and will be solved in the upgraded version.

**In summary the 9 problems faced by a general Finco/Insurco P2P platform are as follows:-**
## 1. Economies of Scale Issue and its Solution : 
<br>**Problem Statement:** Increased Group size leads to increased Operating expense and the network cost increases as number of nodes increase, thereby reducing the cost-performance. Therefore we must build and market such a DeFi platform in which group size shouldn’t matter when calculating admin expenses or loss ratio.
<br><br>**Solution:** We have designed the Platform in such a way that from the Individual Users's perspective there are no incurred Service fees, from the DeFi platform's perspective the operating cost is only the Server Usage cost, and the Cost Burden falls solely on the shoulder of our Key Partners i.e. Banks and NBFC who are happy to shoulder that cost because it also includes customer acquisition cost. We are planning on operating with the premise that the Usage fees is only charged when the Pool is either reinsured or Management outsourced. Customer’s can form groups of any size with just accessing the platform on a Freemium model with Free Membership with value-added in-app purchases.

## 2. Triggering Issue and its Solution : 
<br> **Problem Statement**: Most of the Pooled insurance groups have a major pain point viz. Claims or Maturity triggering criteria are not explicitly quantifiable or fair because most of the DeFi models are not trying to be Full-Stack insurance companies (at least not yet), rather they try to act as the technology provider. Therefore the claim or maturity triggering criteria should be clear and simple to be understood easily by the Customer (or Group) & especially the Assessor and the criteria must be quantifiable so that there is no issue of lack of objectivity from oracle's perspective or from product's perspective.
<br><br>**Solution:** So in order to solve this issue we have decided that the Insurance product or Saving instrument that the Key Partners list on our platform will have to be specifically built exclusively for our customer base's characteristics. For this reason we have made a pre-defined set of product features with associated trigger limitations, wherein certain criteria must be met in order for the claim to be triggered. <br>These pre-defined set of product features is decided by the Key Partners themselves (i.e. Banks or NBFCs) and they can do so through their Dashboard.

## 3. Decision Tree Issue and its Solution : 
<br>**Problem Statement:** Redundancy must be in-built to reduce single-points-of-failure as Oracle based decision making should have redundancies.
<br><br>**Solution:** We have created the decision making architecture in such a way that there are two points of decision tree. First point of failure is Peer Voting System, and then another redundancy is built with an Subject Matter Expert (for e.g. underwriter, Claims manager, etc.) acting as overseer, and depending on the group size and the amount of pooled resources we can increase the number of subject matter experts with weighted decision making powers leading to a highly redundant decision tree.

## 4. Learning Data Issue and its Solution : 
<br>**Problem Statement:** Unless the DeFi platform is created by an Insurance company it doesn't have a lot of Historic Claims Data but data is vital for better decision making at Claim step. So, Historic Data must be made available to all concerned parties for better decision-making.
<br><br>**Solution:** The UI and backend is designed in such a way that the entire Group's transaction history is available for all the members to see. Since, all members of a single group can see all the credit/debit of the group's pooled amount our platform can collect various data and transfer those data analytics to our decision tree architecture. Apart from this design feature, we as a company will also negotiate with several Data agencies to gather public data and use that learning data to optimize the group's decision making abilities.

## 5. Fraud Issue and its Solution : 
<br>**Problem Statement:** Since in a P2P group there is a high risk of Assessor-Claimant nexus, such type of insurance fraud is possible. Therefore we must reduce the chance that the Assessor can collaborate with the Claimant and make fraudulent claims.
<br><br>**Solution:** This type of fraud although can never be entirely eliminated, in our DeFi platform we have reduced the incentive to commit insurance fraud, by adding a punitive measure against the group's pooled resources and also incentivized group members to report any insurance fraud by providing a reward to report such fraudulent transaction. 

## 6. Fraud Reporting Issue and its Solution : 
<br>**Problem Statement:** Tied to the problem number 5, for any Group member there is a low incentive to Flag Fraudulent claims. 
<br><br>**Solution:** We have included a Reporting Incentive & Dis-incentive to the group for a good/bad claim decision by making the decision making as democratic as possible and adding an element of gamification in the decision process, inside the App which is available for all the group members.

## 7. Claims Payout Issue and its Solution* : 
<br>**Problem Statement:** Although for Health or General Insurance the most favourable products are often where the Customers expect Indemnity based payout, instead of Lump-Sum. Therefore the Customers (or Group) should be properly matched with the Product before finalizing sales.
<br><br>**Solution:** In order to solve the Problem of Customer's expectations mismatch we have provided the Groups the leeway to create a tailor-made Claim payout option with the group member through its Group Admin can choose the Benefit format prior to pooling the resources. 
<br><br> _*Problem Number 7,8, and 9 are not System issue rather a business issue._

## 8. Market Maker Issue and its Solution* : 
<br>**Problem Statement:** Currently DeFi platform relies on digital medium as its sales channel. So, we must devise a way to scale-up sustainably, with Break-even Broker Commission  Structure.
<br><br>**Solution:** Part of Daily operational strategy and depends on a case by case basis for each agency/brokerage channels. We have tried to introduce an omni-channel approach to include sales agents and broker along with Digital channel as a means to finalize adaption within the Affinity groups. Omni-Channel approach with Attractive Commission structure for P2P System brokers will lead to buy-in from the sales channel as well.
<br><br> _*Problem Number 7,8, and 9 are not System issue rather a business issue._

## 9. Target Market Issue and its Solution* : 
<br>**Problem Statement:** Finding the right Target market to sell. Primarily targeting those segments that have high growth opportunities and mass-selling appeal.
<br><br>**Solution:** Instead of going for Mass-Market adaption we will focus on the B2B Target Segment in short, medium & long-term focusing mainly on Affinity Groups and B2B sales. 
<br><br> _*Problem Number 7,8, and 9 are not System issue rather a business issue._

<br><br>_Although these are 9 most common problems as faced by Nexus (or other P2P platforms), it should not be taken as an exhaustive list._

## Learnings from the Case Study of Nexus Mutual
Home Page: [Nexus Mutual | A decentralised alternative to insurance](https://nexusmutual.io/)
<br> Whitepaper: [nmx_white_paperv2_3.pdf (nexusmutual.io)](https://nexusmutual.io/assets/docs/nmx_white_paperv2_3.pdf)

Main Issues identified by Nexus Mutual
* Problem of P2P Type Arrangement → Pool is not diverse enough to gain Economies of Scale.
* Problem of Traditional Insurance Arrangement → Doesn’t work unless heavily regulated.
* Cost Issue of Traditional Insurance Arrangement → 35% ANP is lost as Operational Expense.

Claims Assessment in a Oracle based system (single point of truth) has the following problem:-
* Strict Trigger, no payout even if the loss occurred but Trigger not satisfied.
* Failure of Oracle based decision making process.
* Not enough historic data to judge effectively.
* Claims Assessment in a P2P based system (crowd judged) has the following problem:-
* Risk of Fraud High (assessor-indemnee nexus).
* Low incentive for the crowd to flag fraudulent reporting.

Main Solutions identified by Nexus Mutual
* Nexus Mutual aims to reduce the 35% Operational cost to 18%.
* Nexus Mutual aims to create a Token (Equity) and distribute within its ecosystem.

De-Risking a P2P based claim system (Solution to main issues)
* Assessor must have a significant stake in the success of the overall system & high penalty for lying. 
* Knowledgeable experts added in the system to manage the risk (like an in-group underwriter).
* Knowledgeable expert to earn a commission structure based on work done only.
* Limiting the single claim payout as max percentage of the total Pool Amount.

Scheme to incentivize a P2P system
* Fees to “Knowledgeable expert” on successful Consensus Polling (Simple format).
* “Knowledgeable experts” can vote in contrast to the group's opinion.
* If no Consensus is reached then the “Knowledgeable expert” will get a reduced fee.
* Once under the claim process, members can’t decide on another claim process.

Target Audience of Nexus P2P
* B2B sales to a new startup with an IT base.
* B2B sales to an AMCo. to provide confidence to investors.
* B2B sales to a Digital Wallet Co. to provide confidence to its own customers.
* B2C retail sales to customers who want to learn before taking the plunge.


**Distribution Structure  in P2P System**
* Distribution of a P2P product is done with main focus on Community engagement, & promotion to early adapters. 
* Distribution challenges in a P2P system includes, customers expecting Indemnity based products instead of Lump-sum amount as currently common to do. 
* Another challenge is providing an attractive commission structure to the P2P Co.’s brokers.


**Developing a Network Effect in a P2P system is done by following method:-**
* Establishing a network of “Knowledgeable experts”.
* Scale Rapidly
* Continuous improvement of System UI (including functionality).
* Provide a vested interest to all participants in the P2P network.


## To-Do Task in Truakkount gathered from Nexus Mutual
* Must Find a Way to Increase Economies of Scale
* Triggering Criteria should be explicitly quantifiable and must be fair.
* Oracle based decision making should be fail-proof.
* Historic Data Not Available but required for better decision making at Claim step
* Assessor-Claimant Nexus Fraud possible
* Low Incentive for P2P group to Flag Fraudulent reporting.
* Customer Expecting Indemnity based payout, instead of Lump-Sum
* Attractive Commision structure for P2P System brokers.
* Finding the right Target market to sell.
